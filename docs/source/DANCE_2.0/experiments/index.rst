Preprocessing Configuration Library
================

This document provides a curated collection of configuration files for data preprocessing in bioinformatics. The configurations are organized by analytical task, such as Cell Type Annotation, Clustering, and Joint Embedding. Each file details a recommended workflow for a specific algorithm, designed to ensure reproducibility and serve as a best-practice starting point for analysis.
