Preprocessing for Imputation
======================

Imputation is the process of estimating and filling in missing data points. In single-cell analysis, its main application is to address technical "dropout" events, where a gene's expression is not detected despite being present in a cell.
Below, you will find the preprocessing configuration files for several mainstream imputation algorithms.
