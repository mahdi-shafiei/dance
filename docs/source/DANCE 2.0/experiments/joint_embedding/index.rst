Preprocessing for Joint Embedding
======================

Joint Embedding, also known as multi-modal data integration, is the task of combining datasets from different molecular layers, such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq, into a single shared representation. This unified embedding enables holistic downstream analyses, such as clustering cells based on both transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility features.
We have compiled the preprocessing configurations for key multi-modal integration algorithms below.
