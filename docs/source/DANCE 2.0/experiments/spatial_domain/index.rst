Preprocessing for Spatial Domain Identification
======================

Spatial Domain Identification is a computational task specific to spatial transcriptomics. It aims to identify spatially coherent regions or "domains" within a tissue slice by grouping spots with similar gene expression patterns, thereby revealing the tissue's underlying architecture.
This guide outlines the preprocessing configurations for several algorithms designed for this task.
