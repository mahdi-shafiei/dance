Preprocessing for Cell Type Deconvolution
======================

Cell Type Deconvolution is a computational method for estimating the proportions of different cell types from a mixed, bulk tissue sample. It aims to "unmix" a combined molecular signal to reveal the underlying cellular composition.
The following sections detail the preprocessing configurations for key algorithms used in cell type deconvolution.
