Preprocessing for Cell Type Annotation
======================

Cell Type Annotation is the process of assigning a biological identity, such as 'T-cell' or 'neuron', to an individual cell or cluster based on its molecular profile. The primary goal is to determine the specific type and state of each cell in the dataset.
Below, we provide the preprocessing configuration files for several mainstream algorithms designed for this task.
